		<h3> A Brief History and Description of Lebanon </h3>
		<p> The City of Lebanon is strategically located almost equidistant from Harrisburg, Lancaster, and Reading.  Lebanon is accessible from the south via the Pennsylvania  Turnpike and from the north by both I-81 and I-78.  The City’s 25,000 residents are served by numerous public, private and non-profit entities that have a positive impact on the quality of life.</p>
 
 		<p> Originally known as Steitztown, Lebanon City was founded by George  Steitz in 1740.  On November 25, 1885, Lebanon was incorporated as a City of the third class.  Since 1994, the City of Lebanon has operated as a Home Rule Municipality under the Mayor/Council form of government.  The five-member Council is elected at large and all legislative powers are vested in Council.  The Mayor serves as the Chief Executive and Administrative Officer of the City of Lebanon responsible for the Executive Branch of the government. </p>

 		<p> Lebanon City provides 10 parks, 6 playgrounds and walking paths to the residents of the city and surrounding area.  Several tennis courts, a large community swimming pool, park pavilions with picnic facilities and other recreational activities are all available within the city limits.  Coleman Memorial Park is a picturesque 110-acre park deeded to the City of Lebanon in 1937 by G.D. Coleman.  Robert and George Dawson Coleman built the “North Lebanon Furnaces” in 1847 and 1848 on the southern slopes of what is now Coleman’s Park.  Today, a few structures still remain from the Coleman legacy, and the park is an excellent site to hike and explore the rich history of Lebanon’s Royal Family.  Stoever’s Dam Park is comprised of 163 acres with a dam for fishing, habitat for wildlife, a community theater, nature barn, camping facilities, garden plots for rent and hiking and biking trails. </p>
