Lebanon_travel
==============

## Inspiration 

I love Central Pennsylvania, I had the opportunity to create a site on any topic.  I decided to do a community / travel site based on the town of Lebanon.

## How it works 

Using SASS:css, HTML, and Javascript, with some elements from Bootstrap

## Challenges I ran into 

Integrating JavaScript elements like a carousel and image gallery and adding Bootstrap elements without actually using Bootstrap. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of 

I've been told my design elements are very good.  Everyone who has seen my design seems to like it a lot.

## What I learned 

You don't have to use the Bootstrap system in order to use elements of Bootstrap.
